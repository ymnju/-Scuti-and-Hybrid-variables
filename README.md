# Delta-Scuti-and-Hybrid-Variables

δ Scuti and Hybrid variables have been studied in batches in the literature. 

Grigahce`ne et al. (2010) selected 118 δ Scuti and Hybrid variables from 554 
variables provided by the Kepler working group using Q0-Q1 data. 

Uytterhoeven et al. (2011) used the first-year Kepler observations and found 
377 δ Scuti and Hybrid variables from 750 candidate A-F type stars in the Kepler 
Asteroseismic Science Operations Center (KASOC) database. 

Balona (2014) performed their own corrections to Q0-Q12 SAP flux, and detected 
1704 δ Scuti variables with stellar effective temperatures greater than 6500 K 
for all stars or greater than 5000 K for stars brighter than 12.5 magnitude. 

Bradley et al. (2015) adopted more strict constrains on Teff(6200-8200 K),log g
(3.8-4.5), and Kepler magnitude (mostly between 14 and 15.5), which results in 84 δ
Scuti candidates and 32 Hybrid candidates. 

Bowman et al. (2016) used all Kepler data (Q0-Q17) and found 983 δ Scuti and 
Hybrid variables with 6400 ≤ Teff ≤ 10000K and amplitudes greater than 0.10 mmag. 

In addition, we also considered candidates from KASOC database. 

Finally, we obtained a catalog (Version 1) of 1874 δ Scuti and Hybrid variables by summarizing
and merging targets in the above papers.

Catalog Version 2 contains 2261 δ Scuti and Hybrid variables after including the catalog 
from Murphy et al. (2019).
